# Clojure starter pack for Application.garden, Kaocha, Launchpad and Babashka

This repository demonstrates a workflow for continuous delivery without pull requests or third-party CI solutions such as Github Workflows.

## Goal: simple, interactive development

We aim for two goals:

1. Do it as simple as possible.
   Remove that which is not needed.
2. Make interactive systems.
   It is our job to create interactive feedback loops for the systems we create.

## References

We'll build on the following tools:

| Purpose     | Tool               | Documentation                          |
|-------------|--------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Deployment  | Application.garden | https://docs.apps.garden/              |
| Test runner | Kaocha             | https://github.com/lambdaisland/kaocha |
| Scripting   | Babashka           | https://book.babashka.org/             |

Each tool is well worth learning!
Take this repository as a starting point, take what you want, then build in the direction you need.
